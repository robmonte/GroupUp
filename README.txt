GroupUp is an app to help groups of people meet up somewhere at the same time.

The app lets you create accounts and groups which can then be used to coordinate meetups. By setting a destination location and time, each user added to the group who opens the group details will then have their device periodically checking the ETA (estimated time of arrival) to the destination. According to the distance and traffic, a reminder notification will trigger to alert when it is time to leave so that everyone arrives at relatively the same time.

The time between traffic and location updates is customizable through the settings screen, as well as the ability to remember the email that is currently logged into the device. This makes logging in each time a bit quicker for those that don't need to use multiple accounts on one device.

This was an educational app made by three students at The University of Texas at Austin, Michael McCrory, Robert Montefusco, and Victor Yang, while in our iOS Development class. We decided to make an app that may help coordinate group meetups by reducing the waiting time the first person to arrive faces and the guilty feeling the last person to arrive feels.

We hope to clean up some of the functionality and make an Android app counterpart in the future.
